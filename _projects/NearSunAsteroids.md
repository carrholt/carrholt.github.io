## Surface Properties of Near-Sun Asteroids
#### [Holt et al. 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PSJ.....3..187H/abstract)

Many comets and asteroids spend part of their dynamical lifetimes with small perihelion distances (or "low-q'') as a result of dynamical interactions with Jupiter. However, there are fewer such asteroids observed than are predicted by dynamical models, attributed to near-complete disintegration when an asteroid reachs a perihelion distance q < 0.076 au. I am studying asteroids that come close to the Sun to search for signs of near-Sun processes on the surface that might lead to disruption. We have successfully observed the majority of asteroids with a q <0.15 au. We found that interacting processes and varying orbital histories create a wide range of colors. However, a slight preference to bluer colors indicates that resurfacing mechanisms could be dominant (e.g. thermal fatigue).
